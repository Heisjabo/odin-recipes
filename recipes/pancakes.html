        <h2>My dad makes these pancakes. They are the BEST!</h2>
        <p>These were surprisingly excellent! I am on Weight Watchers and was looking for a healthier alternative to traditional pancakes. Using solely whole wheat flour (eliminated the all-purpose flour) gave these a nuttier flavor, but they were so light and fluffy. I substituted 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the butter and used 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp. Splenda instead of sugar.</p>
        <p>I made these exactly as the recipe states only I didn't add the butter-the batter was so thin and watery. I added a whole extra cup of whole wheat flour and it was still super thin. I can't imagine how it would be if I had added the fourth cup of butter. They didn't taste bad though but it took forEVER to make them all.</p>
