    <h2>Sweet/savory hybrids can be tricky sometimes but I think this worked beautifully</h2>
    <p>We are talking about <em>bacon</em>, <em>cheese</em>, and <em>onions</em> after all, so it wasn't that big of a shock. The way the chipotle-spiced maple syrup brought everything together was a risk well rewarded.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces bacon, chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup cornmeal</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes; remove from heat. Stir green onions into bacon and saute in hot fat until slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer bacon mixture to a strainer to drain, retaining drippings.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Add drained bacon mixture, milk, Cheddar cheese, eggs, melted butter, and sugar to flour mixture; whisk until batter is smooth. Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine maple syrup and chipotle chile powder together in a small bowl; whisk until chile powder is completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon bacon drippings, 1 teaspoon oil, and 1 teaspoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by 1/4-cupful onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Transfer pancakes to plate and top with maple syrup.</li>
